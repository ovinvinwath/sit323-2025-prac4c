Steps to use the calculator microservice
- Please make sure you have Node installed on your computer
- Fork this Repository or just download the files
- Open the files on your code editor of choice, i'd recomend VScode
- Make sure all files are in the same folder before the next step
- open the terminal. (if you are using VScode, you can open terminal via CTRL + `)
- Run the server code file by typing "node server.js" on terminal
- to navigate to each calculator function of the microservice, follow the instructions on the welcome page
- please excuse the single line of instructions, yes it does look choppy but the instructions are readable and easy to navigate.
- if you encounter issues, you may adjust the code, such as the router path as you see fit, i have provided detailed documentation on the code files as well.
